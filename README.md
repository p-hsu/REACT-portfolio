## Project overview

My portfolio - featuring projects that I am proud of as well as ways to contact me and view my resume. 

### Project Status:

*ONGOING*

#### Issues to debug:

* projects cards very difficult to translate from non-react hardcoded html/css to React based components
* nav bar changes from side to top with hamburger menu on media query : 
    - nav bar doesn't display
    - therefore no function and NOT mobile friendly >> this should be redesigned from a mobile first perspective
* css is everywhere and very messy...
* images for project cards and resume PDF file not populating/found

****

## Deployment

Github Pages >> https://p-hsu.github.io/REACT-portfolio/
