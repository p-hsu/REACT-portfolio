                Feeling a nagging need for a career change, I decided to take a <span class="light-blue-text text-darken-1">180Ëš</span> pivot from veterinary medicine to the web developer field. I am currently enrolled in a full-stack bootcamp program through <a class="teal-text text-darken-1" href="https://www.trilogyed.com/" aria-label="link to Triology Education Services">Triology Education Services</a> at <a class="teal-text text-darken-1" href="https://bootcamp.tlcenter.wustl.edu/" aria-label="Link to Washington University Saint Louis Bootcamp Program">Washington University</a> here in Saint Louis, Missouri.

                I absorb with facination every new skill learned and every new perspective gained. With discoveries of a passion behind <span class="light-blue-text text-darken-1">human-centric design</span> and <span class="light-blue-text text-darken-1">community-driven projects</span>, I look forward to creating that which can bring about real changes in the world. My meticulous attention to detail and organization serves as a reliable resource for efficient and clean work.
